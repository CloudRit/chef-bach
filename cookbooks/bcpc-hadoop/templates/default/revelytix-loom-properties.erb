# LOOM SERVER CONFIGURATION PROPERTIES
# These should be set up before starting the Loom Server.

# LOOM ACTIVESCAN
# ===============

# Enable table metadata and column statistics scanning
activeScan.table.enabled=<%= node.bcpc.revelytix.activescan-table-enabled %>

# Enable active scanning of potential sources in HDFS.
activeScan.hdfs.enabled=<%= node.bcpc.revelytix.activescan-hdfs-enabled %>

# A comma-separated list of directories under which to scan for potential sources
# in HDFS. Directories may be specified as an absolute hdfs:// URL or a relative
# path that will be resolved against the Loom working directory. The scan is
# recursive, so all sub-directories of each configured directory will be scanned.
# Defaults to the Loom working directory if not set.
activeScan.hdfs.baseDir=hdfs://<%= node.chef_environment %>/user,hdfs://<%= node.chef_environment %>/projects

# The username to run the potential-source scanner service as. A Loom account is
# created with this username when the Loom server is launched, and that account
# will be registered as the owner of any potential sources detected by the scanner.
# When Loom is running with security enabled, this is also the username that will
# be used to access HDFS to detect potential sources, and therefore must have at
# least read access to directories listed in activeScan.hdfs.baseDir.
activeScan.hdfs.scanUser=<%= node.bcpc.revelytix.activescan-hdfs-user %>active-scan

# Set the interval, in minutes, at which Loom will scan HDFS for potential
# sources.
activeScan.hdfs.scanIntervalMinutes=<%= node.bcpc.revelytix.hdfs-scan-interval %>

# The number of records to parse from a file in HDFS to determine whether it's
# a potential source.
activeScan.hdfs.parseLines=<%= node.bcpc.revelytix.parse-lines %>

# The threshold above which the confidence level must be for a file in HDFS
# to be considered a potential source.
# The confidence level is a computed value between 0 and 1.
activeScan.hdfs.scoreThreshold=<%= node.bcpc.revelytix.score-threshold %>

# The maximum amount of data to read into memory from an HDFS file to determine
# whether it's a potential source.
activeScan.hdfs.maxBufferSize=<%= node.bcpc.revelytix.max-buffer-size %>

# LOOM PERSISTENCE
# ================

# Set the dataset persistence mode.
#   hdfs - use HDFS file system and Loom-controlled files (default if not set).
#   hive - use Hive tables.
persist.mode=<%= node.bcpc.revelytix.persist-mode %>

# Sets the location in HDFS where Loom-managed datasets are created, when
# running with 'hdfs' persist mode.
# Defaults to a directory named 'loom-datasets' in the HDFS working directory.
dataset.persist.dir=<%= node.bcpc.revelytix.dataset-persist-dir %>

# Sets the location in HDFS where temporary files live.
# Defaults to a directory named 'loom-temp' in the HDFS working directory.
temporary.file.dir=<%= node.bcpc.revelytix.temporary-file-dir %>

# LOOM JOB EXECUTION
# ==================

# Sets the thread pool size used by the job service for executed processes.
jobService.threadPool.size=<%= node.bcpc.revelytix.job-service-thread-pool-size %>

# LOOM SECURITY AND SSL
# =====================

# Note that some of these properties are commented out.

# Enables or disables Loom security.
# If security is enabled, user impersonation is performed.
security.enabled=<%= node.bcpc.revelytix.security.enabled %>

# Configures how authentication is done: does the user exist and have permission?
# Username and password will always be requested in order to get a session.
#   jaas     - (default) Use JAAS. JAAS is configured in security-unix.conf.
#                Must have a valid session to access API.
#   loom     - Use Loom username/password for a valid session.
#                API rejects requests without a valid session.
#   disabled - Use Loom username/password to get a session.
#                Valid session not required to access API.
security.authentication=<%= node.bcpc.revelytix.security.authentication %>

# Enables SSL (https) support.  Disabled by default.
#
ssl.enabled=<%= node.bcpc.revelytix.ssl.enabled %>

# Configures the SSL port.  Defaults to 8443.
#
ssl.port=<%= node.bcpc.revelytix.ssl.port %>

# Configures the SSL certificate keystore.  Defaults to config/keystore.
#
ssl.keystore=<%= node.bcpc.revelytix.ssl.keystore %>

# Configures the SSL keystore password.  Defaults to "changeit".
# The password can be stored either as plain text or in obfuscated form.
# An obfuscated password is stored by prefixing the password with "OBF:".
# The password can be obfuscated with the bin/password.sh script.
#
ssl.key-password=<%= get_config('revelytix-loom-ssl-password') =>

# Configures the SSL truststore.  No default.
# If nothing is specified, the keystore is used.
#
# ssl.truststore=<%= node.bcpc.revelytix.ssl.trust-store %>

# Configures the SSL truststore password.  No default.
#
# ssl.trust-password=<%= get_config("revelitix-ssl-trust-password") %>

# HADOOP INTEGRATION
# ==================

# Sets the location in HDFS where Loom manages the distributed cache that it
# uses to configure MapReduce jobs that it submits. The Loom server process
# must have permission to write in this location.
loom.dist.cache=loom-dist-cache

# HIVE INTEGRATION
# ================

# These properties apply when Loom is configured to use Hive for persistence.
# See the persist.mode property for configuring Loom persistence.

# A list of comma separated strings representing URIs (JARs) that don't belong
# in the embedded hive classloader. Checked by a simple String.contains().
hive.classloader.blacklistJars=slf4j,log4j,commons-logging


# Custom port
port=8080
